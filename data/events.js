    trailer: "After the final exam, receiving the reports of performance and looking at the scarlet crosses on the papers, many members of our Geekton community expressed bitter complaints about how inhumane the test papers are and how brutal our educational system is. In fact, every student in mainland are sharing exactly the same feeling, and we believe organizing a forum on this topic to be a perfect opportunity for the students’ emotional catharsis and critical thinking ability. During our discussion, we all complained about the rigid curricula commandeering our spare time, misleading materials in our textbooks corroding our minds, and Gaokao system stifling our creativity and judgement. On the other hand, we failed to find a better way, at least a fairer way to fit in our current condition: an excessively populated nation with severely limited resources. A well-written article summarizing our dissatisfaction and explaining why Gaokao the only solution regarding current conditions is now available on our WeChat official account.",

    trailer: "As the US-China trade war intensifies and our peers are deeply infused with a radically patriotic idea, we, founders of Geekton, feel it necessary to find out the real cause of this war and all of its latent consequences in order to promulgate a more objective and rational understanding about this event as well as the way this world around us works. Before the forum, we spent days reading and filtering articles on the tariff war and further developments from varied sources and standpoints, and sent them to all our attenders, who used hold prejudiced stances. Surprisingly, during our intensive discussion in the forum, we heard assorted perspectives not only from chauvinists but also from pessimist, who expressed their deepest concern about the future of our country, the biggest growing economy. After the forum, the Geekton team wrote an article explaining the origin of the conflicts and compiling the opinions from every party and every single, and made a few predictions about the tariff war, which is currently available on our WeChat official account.",

    trailer: "NASA announced the Psyche Mission—provoking shock and criticism among the international community—to understand planet formation by exploring firsthand a brand- new and uncharted corner of the cosmos, and most importantly, to bring back the gold and other rare metals on the asteroid. Its various metals are worth a gargantuan $10,000 quadrillion. Seemingly, carrying all those metals back to earth is capable of making every individual a billionaire. However, our discussion focused more on the negative effects of the excavation: quadrillions of tons of gold and platinum might just destroy commodity prices and cause the world's economy – worth $75.5 trillion – to collapse completely. When we think twice about NASA’s decision, a series of contradictions about this mission will tell us that this is actually not practical at all, and doubts were put forward in our meeting along with fierce discussions……",

    trailer: "The world was stricken with tremendous grief and the entire air industry was shocked by the biggest security problem so far, as a series of air crash of Boeing 737 Max8 was reported on TV. While we lament the tragic deaths of every victim, the very malfunction which pulls the trigger has also intrigued us. So, our community collected a bunch of analysis papers as well as official accident reports which contain more than a hundred pages. As we went through all the articles, we are actually informed with several distinct theories accounting for possible causes. During our discussion, we drew a few models for the causes, but failed to find any flaw in each of them. Also, we made reasonable predictions about the economic and political consequences of such wrecks, and came up with feasible plans against further deterioration.",

Though, as the name suggests, you might consider this problem to be no big deal other than higher temperatures which can be readily solved by air conditioners, while the reality far beyond your imagination, and can lead to catastrophic consequences. For example, the heat wave might expose the crops to latent hyperthermia, which is highly likely to cause massive crop failures, and also compel us to resort to air conditioners more frequently, which will, as an inevitable result, aggravate the power shortages. Whereas,  In the light of this extreme weather can be deadly, our community collected sufficient information to make the problem more intelligible. During our conference, not only did everyone realized the severity of the situation, but also analyzed the potential economic and environmental effects.",
